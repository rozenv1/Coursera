# First install MySQL from any of these links at this URL.
# https://www.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/installing.html
# I installed MySQL Community Server 8.0.16 (usually the community edition, INCLUDING the C-Connector)
# Second, install RTools by following the instructions and configurations: http://www.ahschulz.de/2013/07/23/installing-rmysql-under-windows/
# or by going directly to http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/Main/RMySQL

# First, connect to the db by using dbConnect and assign the connection a handle.
# In this case, this opens the connection and this connection is given this handle ucscDb.
ucscDB<-dbConnect(MySQL(), user="genome",
                  host="genome-mysql.cse.ucsc.edu")
# Next, you apply a query to the database by using the dbGetQuery command.
# the TRUE response you get is that you succesfully disconnected from the connection to ucscDB.

result<-dbGetQuery(ucscDB,"show databases;"); dbDisconnect(ucscDB);

# the results is a list of all the dbs available within MySQL server that is located at the host address:

## Getting Dimensions of a specific table
# looking at all the fields in a particular dataframe or table "affyU133Plus2"
dbListFields(hg19,"affyU133Plus2")
# finding out how many rows or # of records in this dataset
dbGetQuery(hg19, "select count(*) from affyU133Plus2")

##  Read from the table, and extracting the data one table at a time.
affyData<-dbReadTable(hg19,"affyU133Plus2")

query <- dbSendQuery(hg19, "select * from affyU133Plus2 where misMatches between 1 and 3")
affyMis <- fetch(query); quantile(affyMis$misMatches)
affyMisSmall <- fetch(query,n=10); dbClearResult(query); # this allows you download only the 10 first records and then close the connection to the query.
